## **Exploration Phase:** 
Who does not like a good quiz to test their knowledge on a random topic? Generic Quiz games have an ability to engage a wide demographic, from a school student to one's grandmother. 

While digital technology continues to reshape human interactions with art, quiz games have emerged as a popular method for engaging audiences in the exploration of artistic knowledge.  

In the exploration stage of the game development, we approached a variety of people, of different ages and vocations; a secondary school student studying art, an art college graduate, a senior software developer, a housewife and a retired mechanical engineer. We showed them a selection of historical fine art paintings and asked them to either name the art movement or the artist who created it. Surprisingly, our participants showed a lot more knowledge than anticipated; while the students who studied art exhibited greater knowledge of the subject, those with no background in art had some knowledge of almost every image shown.  

Thus, the conclusion was made that many must have a basic knowledge in art history; having acquired it in school or from attending museum as entertainment, and as long as the game is simple enough, it can be accessible and experienced by many demographics and also offer extra information to those who like to learn.  

### **User Experience(UX)**

### **User Interface(UI)** 
Art History Quiz site comprises of three sections, each activated when a specific button is triggered. 

- **Landing Section :** 
  - This section introduces the quiz and gives instructions explaining the task and aim of the game to the user.  
  - Its aim is not only to introduce but visually entice the user to play the quiz game. 

- **Game Section :** 
  - This section contains the game board in its entirety. It consists of a heading section with the name of the quiz and reveals a score box; the main section contains 11 historically famous paintings, with four option buttons.  
  - Some features are disguised and revealed when a selection is made and give instant feedback on whether the selection is right or wrong. 

- **Game End Section :** 
  - This section consists of a heading that only shows the name of the quiz; and a main section notifying the user that they reached the end of the quiz with a final score number and a message that changes depending on the score acquired. 
  - It also provides the user with a button option to play again. 

#### **Wireframes:** 
The quiz is responsive on all screen types: Mobiles, Tablets and Laptops. 

  - __Mobile Screen view and all featured described:__

    ![Wireframes for Laptop screens](docs/screenshots/wireframes_laptop.jpg) 

#### **Color Scheme:** 
- The color scheme for the quiz was inspired by art museums and painting palettes with bright contrasting blues and oranges. This theme reflects the theme of the quiz.<br>
  ![Art Museum inspiration](docs/screenshots/art_museum.jpg) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  ![Easel inspiration](docs/screenshots/easel_smaller.jpg)    
- These colors are rejuvinating and instill a sense of refreshment, which is very fitting to the setting of the art quiz. Oranges and light blue are complementary to each other, while grey, white and dark grey, add accent and contrast. 
- This palette with a selection of colors was manually generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
- The pallet was then scored on contrast levels on [Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/); to make sure that the color combinations are not clashing and are suitable to use for accessibility purposes.
  ![Color Scheme chosen for the project](docs/screenshots/color-scheme.jpg) 
   
#### **Typography:**
The fonts were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  - These fonts are easy to read and are fitting with the theme of the quiz.
  - For the header(h1) of the quiz "Limelight" font was used, and for the body headings (h2, h3, h4) and paragraphs the "Antic Slab" font was used.
